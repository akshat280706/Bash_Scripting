# !/bin/bash

word="awesome"
#if we change the word to word="fun" then everywhere it would change to fun instead of awesome
#so we won't have to again and again manually change the word awesome from each line, that is why scripting is important

echo "Linux is $word"
echo "bash is $word"
echo "sunny days are $word"
